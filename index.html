            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a product designer and researcher with a passion for blending technology, design, and
                data-driven insights to create impactful solutions. With a Bachelors in Design Computing from
                the University of Sydney and a pursuit of a Master’s in Information Science at Cornell
                University, I specialize in designing human-centered systems that merge creativity with
                cutting-edge technology.

            <h2>Ongoing Endeavors</h2>
            <p>
                My work spans AI-driven natural language processing systems, interactive product design, and
                mathematical modeling, reflecting a unique ability to tackle complex problems through iterative
                design and analytical thinking. Whether it’s improving AI dialogue systems to deliver better
                user experiences or developing tools for early autism detection, I thrive at the intersection of
                innovation and usability.
